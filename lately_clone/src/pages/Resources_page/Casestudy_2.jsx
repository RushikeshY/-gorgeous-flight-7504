    <h3>Tamarin Health – Amplifying Employee Advocacy Campaign Across All Social Media Platforms with Lately.ai</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Tamarin Health’s mission is to improve access to and decrease the cost of healthcare. To attain their mission, they’ve built a global ecosystem of partners, clinicians and healthcare tools, making it easier for leaders in all industries to create an inclusive, healthy environment. Tamarin spent the last year building a clinical network and global testing portfolio specifically aimed at combating COVID-19.  Their blockchain-backed Gather Safely™Platform anchors their COVID-19 tools and is user based – which means the individual user manages and maintains access to their data and Health Pass. <br/>By creating a robust network and being test-agnostic, Tamarin Health is the most inclusive way to create the safest environment. Leaders who value their team and customers create safe environments using Tamarin Health’s clinical network, a variety of testing options and Gather Safely™ Platform. 
<br/>
With Tamarin’s robust but simple-to-use platform, customers have the ability to navigate through the challenges of a COVID-19 lockdown. But, as a niche health providing platform, Tamarin Health struggled to keep up with everyday marketing of their product. So, they decided to start an advocacy campaign to grow their audience in their social channels.  Equipped with a small marketing team, Tamarin Health began using Lately‘s social media A.I.<br/> content management platform to create high impact social content across all platforms to advocate for their mission. 
<br/>
In 2020, Tamarin Health selected Lately.ai to amplify their awareness campaign around COVID-19 and best practices.
Tamarin Health’s initial marketing campaign was focused on a niche target market with little room for growth. Lately allows them to design their new advocacy campaign by not only targeting their initial niche market, but also scaling their marketing presence to both local businesses and communities. Tamarin Health has experienced consistent organic growth with the help of Lately’s A.I. keywords and automatic scheduling.
